Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_remove_dublicates
#problem description: Construct a function which creates a new list where it stores all elements except the duplicates from the list given as a parameter. Finally, the function should return a new list.
def remove_dup(list_of_num):
    new_list = []
    for element in list_of_num:
        if element not in new_list:
            new_list.append(element)
