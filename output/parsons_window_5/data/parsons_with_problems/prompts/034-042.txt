Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_palindrome1
#problem description: Construct a function which determines whether the string given as a paramter is a palindrome. The function should be case insensitive i.e. upper and lowercase letters are intepreted as being the same.
def is_palindrome(str):
    n_str = str.lower()
    revers_str = ""
    for char in n_str:

    if n_str == revers_str:
            print("This string is a palindrome!")
    else:
        print("The string is not a palindrome!")
