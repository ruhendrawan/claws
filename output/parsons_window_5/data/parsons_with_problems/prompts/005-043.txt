Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
StringMethod,capitalize(),
StringMethod,lower(),
StringMethod,replace(),
StringMethod,join(),
ClassMethod,__init()__,
```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_palindrome2
#problem description: Construct a program which determines whether the original string is a palindrome. The function should be case insensitive i.e. upper and lowercase letters are intepreted as being the same.
str = "Madam"
n_str = str.lower()
revers_str = ""
for char in n_str:
    revers_str = char + revers_str
if n_str == revers_str:
    print("This string is a palindrome!")
else:
    print("The string is not a palindrome!")
