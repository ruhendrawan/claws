```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_stack
#problem description: Construct a program that creates two functions in a  Stack Structure. The first one is "push" function and the second one is "pop" function. Your pop function should also check if the current stack is empty. is_empty() is a predefined function.
def push(self, item):
	self.items.insert(0, item)
def pop(self):
	if self.is_empty():
		print("error stack is empty")
	else:
