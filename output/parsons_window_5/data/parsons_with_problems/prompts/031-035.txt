Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
HandlingList,DeletingListElement,
HandlingList,CreatingList,
HandlingList,ReplacingListElement,list[index]= value
HandlingList,ReversingList,
HandlingList,ListReferencing,"ListReferencing refers to the code in which one list is set equal to another, and a change to one of the lists causes the same change in the other list. ListReferencing should only be marked as present if a list is explicitly assigned to another list variable (e.g., list2 = list1)."
```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_3digit_combinations
#problem description: Construct a program which creates and prints all three-digit combinations from numbers 1-4 such that each number appears at most once and the combinations are listed from the smallest to the greatest. The program must also output the total number of the combinations. For example, output 123, 124, 132 ... total: 24.
amount = 0
i = 0
while i < 4:
  i += 1
  j = 0
  while j < 4:
    j += 1
    k = 0
    while k < 4:
      k += 1
      if k != i and k != j and i != j:
          amount += 1
          print(i, j, k)

print("The total number of 3 digit combinations is", amount)
