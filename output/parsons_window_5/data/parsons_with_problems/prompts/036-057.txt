You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

#problem description: Construct a program which determines whether the value of one of variables x, y, and z is the sum of the values of the two other variables.
if x + y == z $$toggle::and::or::not$$ x + z == y $$toggle::and::or::not$$ y + z == x:
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")
