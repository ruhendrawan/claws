Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
BuiltInFunction,max(),
BuiltInFunction,len(),
StringMethod,rstrip(),
StringMethod,format(),

```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_fast_power1
#problem description: Construct a program which calculates the base raised to the power of the exponent.
base = 2
exp = 5
temp = 1
while exp > 0:
    if exp % 2 == 0:
        base = base * base
        exp = exp // 2
    else:
        temp = base * temp
        exp = exp - 1
result = temp
print(result)
