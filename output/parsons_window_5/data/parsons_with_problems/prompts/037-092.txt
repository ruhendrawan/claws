Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_quick_sorting
#problem description: Construct a function that implements quick sort algorithm. The partition() function has been pre defined and displayed below.<br/>Consider data is a list, first is the first element's index and last is the last element's index
def quick_sort(data, first, last):
	if first < last:
		pivot = partition(data, first, last)
		quick_sort(data, first, pivot-1)
		quick_sort(data, pivot+1, last)
	return data
