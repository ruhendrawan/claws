## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_divisible_by3
#problem description: Construct a program which checks which of the integers in interval from 1 to 50 is divisible by only 2, only 5, or both. The program should store each group in its own list and finally print the lists in this order.
num = 50
list = []
list2= []
list3= []
    
for i in range(1, num + 1):
    if i % 2 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        list.append(i)
    elif i % 2 == 0:
        list2.append(i)
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        list3.append(i)
print("divisible by only 2:")
