Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

#problem description: Construct a program to print a multiplication chart given the chart_size. Assume that chart_size is set to a positive integer.
for j in range(1, chart_size + 1):
    for i in range(1, chart_size + 1):
        print(i * j, " ", end="")
    print()
