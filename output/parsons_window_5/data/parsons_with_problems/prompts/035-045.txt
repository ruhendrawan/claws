You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_palindrome4
#problem description: Construct a function that checks if the string is a palindrome or not. The function should be case insensitive i.e. upper and lowercase letters are intepreted as being the same
def is_palindrome(str):
    i = 0
    j = len(str) - 1
    n_str = str.lower()
    while i < j:

        i += 1
        j -= 1
