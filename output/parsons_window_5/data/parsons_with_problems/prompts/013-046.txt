## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_list_of_remainders1
#problem description: Construct a function which calculates the remainder of each element of the first list and the element with the same index in the second list. The remainders are stored in a new list. If the number in the second list is 0, the function should directly add number 2 to the new list instead of the remainder.
def list_of_remainders(list1, list2):
    new_list = []
    if len(list1) == len(list2):
        for i in range(len(list1)):
            if list2[i] == 0:
                new_list.append(2)
            else:
                result = list1[i] % list2[i]
                new_list.append(result)
    return new_list
