You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)

ManagingVariable,UpdatingVariable,UpdatingVariable refers to when a variable that was already assigned to a value is update (e.g. x+=1 or x=x+1)
```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
