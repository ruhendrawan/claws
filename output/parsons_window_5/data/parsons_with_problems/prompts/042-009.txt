Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
ManagingVariable,AssigningVariable,

```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_nested_calls
#problem description: First define a calculate function and then define double function (that returns the given value doubled). Then write a program that first prints out 20 and then 36.
def calculate(first, second):
  return second * 3 + first
def double(value):
  return value * 2
print(double(double(5)))
print(calculate(double(3), 2 + calculate(5, 1)))
