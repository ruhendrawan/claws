Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

HandlingFunction,NestedFunctionCall,"NestedFunctionCall refers to when one function call is placed as an argument to another function call (e.g., f(g(x)))"
HandlingStandardFunction,CallingStandardFunction,CallingStandardFunction refers to calling a function that meets all the 3 following criteria:1) Does not call any other user-defined functions 2) Is not nested inside another function 3) Does not call itself (not recursive) Note: A standard function may still call built-in functions.
HandlingStandardFunction,DefiningStandardFunction,"DefiningStandardFunction refers to defining a function that: 1) Does not call any other user-defined functions 2) Is not nested inside another function 3) Does not call itself (not recursive) Note: A standard function may still call built-in functions. Additionally, DefiningStandardFunction can still be later called in nested patterns (NestedFunctionCall)."
HandlingNestedFunction,CallingNestedFunction,CallingNestedFunction refers to the call of functions that have in their code the definition of other user-defined functions
HandlingNestedFunction,DefiningNestedFunction,DefiningNestedFunction refers to defining a function inside another user-defined function.

```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_queue
#problem description: Construct a function that uses Queue Structure to solve a Josephus problem that removes the kth element in a given list and returns the last left element. All Queue's functions are predefined (is_empty(), enqueue() and dequeue()). Your function should also return a "The list is empty" message if the given list is empty.
def circle(k,name_list):
	q = Queue()
	if not q.is_empty():
		for i in range(len(name_list)):
			q.enqueue(name_list[i])
		i = 1
		while q.size()!=1:
			temp=q.dequeue()
			if i != k+1:
				q.enqueue(temp)
			else:
				i = 0
			i += 1
	else:
		return (\'the list is empty!\')
	return q.dequeue()
