Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_remove_dublicates2
#problem description: Construct a program which creates a new list where it stores all elements except the duplicates from the original list. Finally, the program should print the original list and the new list.
new_list = []
for element in old_list:
    if element not in new_list:
        new_list.append(element)

print("The original list:", old_list)
print("The new list:", new_list)
