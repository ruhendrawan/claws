Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

HandlingFunction,NestedFunctionCall,"NestedFunctionCall refers to when one function call is placed as an argument to another function call (e.g., f(g(x)))"
HandlingStandardFunction,CallingStandardFunction,CallingStandardFunction refers to calling a function that meets all the 3 following criteria:1) Does not call any other user-defined functions 2) Is not nested inside another function 3) Does not call itself (not recursive) Note: A standard function may still call built-in functions.
HandlingStandardFunction,DefiningStandardFunction,"DefiningStandardFunction refers to defining a function that: 1) Does not call any other user-defined functions 2) Is not nested inside another function 3) Does not call itself (not recursive) Note: A standard function may still call built-in functions. Additionally, DefiningStandardFunction can still be later called in nested patterns (NestedFunctionCall)."
HandlingNestedFunction,CallingNestedFunction,CallingNestedFunction refers to the call of functions that have in their code the definition of other user-defined functions
HandlingNestedFunction,DefiningNestedFunction,DefiningNestedFunction refers to defining a function inside another user-defined function.

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_3digit_combinations
#problem description: Construct a program which creates and prints all three-digit combinations from numbers 1-4 such that each number appears at most once and the combinations are listed from the smallest to the greatest. The program must also output the total number of the combinations. For example, output 123, 124, 132 ... total: 24.
amount = 0
i = 0
while i < 4:
  i += 1
  j = 0
  while j < 4:
    j += 1
    k = 0
    while k < 4:
      k += 1
      if k != i and k != j and i != j:
          amount += 1
          print(i, j, k)

print("The total number of 3 digit combinations is", amount)
