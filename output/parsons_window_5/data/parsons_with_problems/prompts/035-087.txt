You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_stack
#problem description: Construct a program that creates two functions in a  Stack Structure. The first one is "push" function and the second one is "pop" function. Your pop function should also check if the current stack is empty. is_empty() is a predefined function.
def push(self, item):
	self.items.insert(0, item)
def pop(self):
	if self.is_empty():
		print("error stack is empty")
	else:
		return self.items.pop(0)
