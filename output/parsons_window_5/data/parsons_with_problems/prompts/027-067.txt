Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_fast_power2
#problem description: Construct a function which calculates the power of a number. The function takes two integers as parameters (the base number and a non-negative exponent) and calculates the power.
def power(base, exp):
    temp = 1.0
    while exp > 0:
        if exp % 2 == 0:
            base = base * base
            exp = exp // 2
        else:
            temp = base * temp
            exp = exp - 1
    result = temp
    return result
