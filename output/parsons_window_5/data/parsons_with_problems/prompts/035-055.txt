You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

#problem description: Construct a program which creates a new list that is the reverse of the orginal list.
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
new_list = [0] * len(list1)
j = len(list1)
for number in list1:
    j = j - 1 
    new_list[j] = number
