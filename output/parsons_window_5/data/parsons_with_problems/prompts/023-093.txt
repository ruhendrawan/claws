Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_tree_inorder_traversal
#problem description: Construct an inorder traversal function that recursively traverse a tree from left node, root node and right node. We store the traversed tree in a list called res=[]. The traversal function is inside of the tree class. Consider the tree class has been predefined.
