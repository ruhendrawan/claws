You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_calculation_in_dictionary
#problem description: Construct  a program that calculates each studentâ€™s average score by using `studentdict` dictionary that is already defined as follows:
for item in studentdict.items():
	name=item[0]
	scores=item[1]
	total=0
	for score in scores:
		total+=score
	ave = total/len(scores)
	print("The average score of",name, "is",ave)
