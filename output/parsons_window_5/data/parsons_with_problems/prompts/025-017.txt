You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_dict_values
#problem description: Construct a program that prints out how many items in total are in storage. You can assume that a dictionary called storage has already been initialized.
total_items = 0
for item_count in storage.values():
  total_items += item_count
print(total_items)
