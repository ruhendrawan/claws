You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_easy_power1
#problem description: Construct a function which takes the base and the exponent as parameters and returns the base raised to the exponent. Call the function to calculate 2 raised to the power of 5.
def power(base, exp):

    result = 1
    i = 1
    while i $$toggle::<::>::<=::>=$$ exp:
        result = result * base
        i += 1

    return result

new_num = power(2, 5)
print(new_num)
