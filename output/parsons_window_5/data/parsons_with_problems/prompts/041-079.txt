Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
ManagingVariable,SwappingVariablesValue,"Refers to when variables are swapped (e.g.
temp =a
a=b
b=temp
)"
```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_nested_whiles
#problem description: Construct a program to print an upside-down right triangle. Assume that 'size' is defined, and holds an integer value.
while size > 0:
	m=0
	while m < size:
		print("*",end="")
		m=m+1
	size=size-1
	print()
```
