Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps

#problem description: Construct a merge function that recursively splits a numeric array and takes a list as a parameter called data.<br/>Consider that merge_sort() function is already defined and given below.
def merge(data):
	if len(data) <= 1:
		return data
	middle = len(data)//2
	left = merge(data[:middle])
	right = merge(data[middle:])
	return merge_sort(left, right)
