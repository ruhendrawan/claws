You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes

#problem description: Construct a program using inheritance of classes to display a studentâ€™s name and score. Consider student as an instance of class Score.
class Student():
	def __init__(self, name):
		self.name=name
	def getName(self):
		return self.name
class Score(Student):
	def __init__(self, name, score):
		self.score=score
