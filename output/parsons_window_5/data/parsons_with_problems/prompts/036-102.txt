You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_json_agg_3
#problem description: Compute and display the average (mean) age
for person in people:
    total_age += person["age"]
    count += 1

average_age = total_age / count if count > 0 else 0

print(f"Average age: {average_age:.2f}")
