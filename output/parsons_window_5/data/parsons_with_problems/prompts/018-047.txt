Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_list_of_remainders2
#problem description: Construct a program which calculates the remainder of each element of the first list and the element with the same index in the second list. The remainders are stored in a new list. If the number in the second list is 0, the program should directly add number 2 to the new list instead of the remainder. Finally, the program should print the new list.
list1 = [19, 3, 4, 2]
list2 = [4, 2, 1, 9]

new_list = []
if len(list1) == len(list2):
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        if list2[i] == 0:
            new_list.append(2)
        else:
            result = list1[i] % list2[i]
            new_list.append(result)

print(new_list)
