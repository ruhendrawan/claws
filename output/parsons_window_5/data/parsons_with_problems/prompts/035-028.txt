You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_xor
#problem description: Construct a program that mimics a XOR gate (exclusive or). When input_a and input_b are the same, it should print out 0 and in other cases print out 1.
if input_a == 1 $$toggle::and::or::not::$$ input_b == 1:
	print($$toggle::0::1::$$)
elif input_a == 0 $$toggle::and::or::not::$$ input_b == 0:
	print($$toggle::0::1::$$)
else:
	print($$toggle::0::1::$$)
