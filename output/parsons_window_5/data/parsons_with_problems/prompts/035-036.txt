Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_3digit_combinations2
#problem description: Construct a program which creates and prints all three-digit combinations from numbers 1-4 such that each number appears at most once and the combinations are listed from the smallest to the greatest. The program must also output the total number of the combinations. For example, output 123, 124, 132 ... total: 24.

i = 0
while i < 4:
  i += 1
  j = 0
  while j < 4:
    j += 1
    k = 0
    while k < 4:
      k += 1
      if k != i $$toggle::and::or::not::$$ k != j $$toggle::or::and::not::$$ i != j:
          amount += 1
          print(i, j, k)

print("The total number of 3 digit combinations is", amount)
