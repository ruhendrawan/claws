You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
ManagingVariable,SwappingVariablesValue,"Refers to when variables are swapped (e.g.
temp =a
a=b
b=temp
)"
```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_linked_list_traversal
#problem description: Construct a function that prints all elements of a Doubly Linked List in forwards and then reverse order.<br/>DoublyLinkedList class implementation is given below.
def traverse_list(doubly_linked_list):
  current = doubly_linked_list.head
  while current:
    print(current.data, end=" ")
    last = current
    current = current.next
  while last:
    print(last.data, end=" ")
    last = last.prev
