Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

HandlingFunction,NestedFunctionCall,"NestedFunctionCall refers to when one function call is placed as an argument to another function call (e.g., f(g(x)))"
HandlingStandardFunction,CallingStandardFunction,CallingStandardFunction refers to calling a function that meets all the 3 following criteria:1) Does not call any other user-defined functions 2) Is not nested inside another function 3) Does not call itself (not recursive) Note: A standard function may still call built-in functions.
HandlingStandardFunction,DefiningStandardFunction,"DefiningStandardFunction refers to defining a function that: 1) Does not call any other user-defined functions 2) Is not nested inside another function 3) Does not call itself (not recursive) Note: A standard function may still call built-in functions. Additionally, DefiningStandardFunction can still be later called in nested patterns (NestedFunctionCall)."
HandlingNestedFunction,CallingNestedFunction,CallingNestedFunction refers to the call of functions that have in their code the definition of other user-defined functions
HandlingNestedFunction,DefiningNestedFunction,DefiningNestedFunction refers to defining a function inside another user-defined function.

```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_divisible_by3
#problem description: Construct a program which checks which of the integers in interval from 1 to 50 is divisible by only 2, only 5, or both. The program should store each group in its own list and finally print the lists in this order.
num = 50
list = []
list2= []
list3= []
    
for i in range(1, num + 1):
    if i % 2 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        list.append(i)
    elif i % 2 == 0:
        list2.append(i)
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        list3.append(i)
