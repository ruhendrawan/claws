Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
HandlingList,DeletingListElement,
HandlingList,CreatingList,
HandlingList,ReplacingListElement,list[index]= value
HandlingList,ReversingList,
HandlingList,ListReferencing,"ListReferencing refers to the code in which one list is set equal to another, and a change to one of the lists causes the same change in the other list. ListReferencing should only be marked as present if a list is explicitly assigned to another list variable (e.g., list2 = list1)."

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code

#problem description: Construct a program which checks whether each of the integers in interval from 1 to 100 is divisible by 2, 5, or both.
num = 100
for i in range(1, num + 1):
    if i % 2 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:

    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print(i, "is only divisible by 5")
    elif i % 2 == 0:
        print(i, "is only divisible by 2")
    else:
