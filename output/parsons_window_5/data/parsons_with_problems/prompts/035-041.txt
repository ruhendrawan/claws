Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_freq_of_char2
#problem description: Construct a program which counts the frequency of each character in string 'Summer' and stores it in a dictionary. Finally, the program should print the dictionary.
str = "Summer"
num_of_char = {}
for letter in str:
    if letter in num_of_char:
        num_of_char[letter] += 1
    else:
