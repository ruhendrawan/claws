You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

HandlingFunction,NestedFunctionCall,"NestedFunctionCall refers to when one function call is placed as an argument to another function call (e.g., f(g(x)))"
HandlingStandardFunction,CallingStandardFunction,CallingStandardFunction refers to calling a function that meets all the 3 following criteria:1) Does not call any other user-defined functions 2) Is not nested inside another function 3) Does not call itself (not recursive) Note: A standard function may still call built-in functions.
HandlingStandardFunction,DefiningStandardFunction,"DefiningStandardFunction refers to defining a function that: 1) Does not call any other user-defined functions 2) Is not nested inside another function 3) Does not call itself (not recursive) Note: A standard function may still call built-in functions. Additionally, DefiningStandardFunction can still be later called in nested patterns (NestedFunctionCall)."
HandlingNestedFunction,CallingNestedFunction,CallingNestedFunction refers to the call of functions that have in their code the definition of other user-defined functions
HandlingNestedFunction,DefiningNestedFunction,DefiningNestedFunction refers to defining a function inside another user-defined function.

```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_nested_calls
#problem description: First define a calculate function and then define double function (that returns the given value doubled). Then write a program that first prints out 20 and then 36.
def calculate(first, second):
  return second * 3 + first
def double(value):
  return value * 2
print(double(double(5)))
print(calculate(double(3), 2 + calculate(5, 1)))
