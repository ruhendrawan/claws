Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
ManagingVariable,SwappingVariablesValue,"Refers to when variables are swapped (e.g.
temp =a
a=b
b=temp
)"
```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_list_reverse7
#problem description: Construct a program which creates a new list that is reverse of list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
def list_reverse(lst):
    new_list = [0] * len(lst)
    j = len(lst)
    for number in lst:
        j = j - 1
        new_list[j] = number 
    return new_list

list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = list_reverse(list1)
print(list2)
