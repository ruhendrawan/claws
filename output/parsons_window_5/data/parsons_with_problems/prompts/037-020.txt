Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_bigger_than
#problem description: Assume that num1 and num2 have been initialized to numbers, so that number1 is bigger. Construct a program that correctly prints out that number1 is indeed bigger
print("num1 is bigger:", num1 > num2)
print("num1 is bigger:", num1 < num2) #distractor
