#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_divisible_by2
#problem description: Construct a program which checks whether each of the integers in interval from 1 to 100 is divisible by 2, 5, or both.
num = 100
for i in range(1, num + 1):
    if i % 2 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print(i, "is divisible by 2 & 5")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print(i, "is only divisible by 5")
    elif i % 2 == 0:
        print(i, "is only divisible by 2")
    else:           
        print(i, "is not divisible by 2 nor 5")
