#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_list_basic2
#problem description: Construct a program that initializes a list with five floating-point numbers, changes the second element in the list, and finally, prints the list.
#Step 1: Define a list of five floating-point numbers
lst = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5]
#Step 2: Update the list element
lst[1] = 20.5
#Step 3: Print the list
