Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

HandlingNestedFunction,DefiningNestedFunction,DefiningNestedFunction refers to defining a function inside another user-defined function.

HandlingStandardFunction,DefiningStandardFunction,"DefiningStandardFunction refers to defining a function that: 1) Does not call any other user-defined functions 2) Is not nested inside another function 3) Does not call itself (not recursive) Note: A standard function may still call built-in functions. Additionally, DefiningStandardFunction can still be later called in nested patterns (NestedFunctionCall)."
HandlingStandardFunction,CallingStandardFunction,CallingStandardFunction refers to calling a function that meets all the 3 following criteria:1) Does not call any other user-defined functions 2) Is not nested inside another function 3) Does not call itself (not recursive) Note: A standard function may still call built-in functions.

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_char_dict
#problem description: Construct a program that has a function which receives a string from the user and creates a dictionary that maps each character in the given string to its frequency, that is, how many times that character appears in the given string. For example, if the given string is "book", the program creates the following dictionary: b : 1, o : 2, k : 1
#Step 1: Define the function
def create_dictionary(s):
    #Step 1.1: Create an empty dictionary
    counts = {}
    #Step 1.2: Update the dictionary entries as we iterate through the string characters
    for char in s:
        if char in counts:
            counts[char] += 1
        else:
            counts[char] = 1
    #Step 1.3: Print the dictionary
    print("The character counts for", s)
    for char in counts:
        print(char, ":", counts[char])
#Step 2: Call the function
s = input("Enter a string: ")
create_dictionary(s)
```
