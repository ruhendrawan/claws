You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
WhileLoopWithUpdate,WhileLoopWithListIndexing,WhileLoopWithListIndexing refers to when there is an indexing of a list happening inside a while loop
NestedLoopIteration,MixedNestedLoopIteration,MixedNestedLoopIteration refers to nested loop such that a while-loop inside a for-loop or a for-loop inside a while-loop
NestedLoopIteration,NestedWhileLoopIteration,NestedWhileLoopIteration refers to nested loop such that a while-loop is inside another while-loop
NestedLoopIteration,NestedForLoopIteration,NestedForLoopIteration refers to nested loop such that  a for-loop is inside another for-loop

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_list_change
#problem description: Construct a program that increments all values of the list by 1.
#Step 1: Define and initialize the list
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
#Step 2: Iterate through the list elements
for i in range(len(lst)):
    #Step 2.1: Increment the element at index i by 1
    lst[i] += 1
#Step 3: Print the list
print(lst)
```
