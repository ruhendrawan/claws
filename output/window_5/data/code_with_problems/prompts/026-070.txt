You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_concat_string_num3
#problem description: Construct a program that uses variables x, y, and z to print "10 + 20 = 30".
#Step 1: Assign initial values to the variables x, y, and z
x = 10
y = 20
z = x + y
#Step 2: Print the text using the variables initialized above
print(str(x) + " + " + str(y) + " = " + str(z))
```
