## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_concat_char_two_str
#problem description: Construct a program that has a function that receives two strings and returns a string formed from the given strings such that the first character of each string is omitted. For example, the new string that will be formed from the strings 'abc' and 'xyz' is 'bcyz'. Assume that both strings have at least one character.
#Step 1: Define the function
def concat_chars(a, b):
    return a[1:] + b[1:]
#Step 2: Call the function
print(concat_chars("Hello", "There"))
