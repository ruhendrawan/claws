Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_list2d_basic
#problem description : Construct a program that initializes a 3x4 two-dimensional matrix that has the numbers 1 through 12 for entries, updates the last row to a list filled with 5s, then sets the left-most element in the middle row of the matrix to be 20, and finally prints the matrix.
#Step 1: Define a 3x4 two-dimensional list
matrix = [[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ],
        [ 5, 6, 7, 8 ],
        [ 9, 10, 11, 12]]
#Step 2: Update the two-dimensional list
matrix[2] = [5, 5, 5, 5]
matrix[1][0] = 20
#Step 3: Print the list
print(matrix)
