Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_nested_if_min_max
#problem decsription: Construct a program that determines the smallest of the three integer values entered by the user.
#Step 1: Read the three integers
text = input("Enter the first integer: ")
num1 = int(text)
text = input("Enter the second integer: ")
num2 = int(text)
text = input("Enter the third integer: ")
num3 = int(text)
#Step 2: Determine the minimum integer
if num1 < num2 :
    if num1 < num3 :
        min_num = num1
    else :
        min_num = num3
else :
    if num2 < num3 :
        min_num = num2
    else :
        min_num = num3
#Step 3: Print the minimum integer
print("Minimum value:", min_num)
