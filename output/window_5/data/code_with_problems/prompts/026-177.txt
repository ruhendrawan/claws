You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_list_fill
#problem description: Construct a program that creates a list of first ten positive odd numbers.
#Step 1: Create an empty list
lst = []
#Step 2: Add the odd numbers to the list one by one
for i in range(10):
    lst.append( 2 * i + 1 )
#Step 3: Print the list
print(lst)
