Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
Python,FindingLength,refers to the expression len()
Python,CheckingForItem,check for item with the 'in' construct
Python,Concatenation,

```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: q_py
#exercise name: q_py_topic_exceptions:q_py_exception_assertion
def test(arr):
    new_list = []
    eCount = 0
    for item in arr:
        try:
            assert isinstance(item,int)
        except AssertionError:
            eCount += 1
            new_list.append(item)
    print(eCount)
    print(new_list)
arr = [5, 4, "six", 7, 0, "12", 9, "eleven", "1", 8, "nine", "1"]
