Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
HandlingTuple,IndexingTuple,
HandlingList,ReplacingListElement,list[index]= value
HandlingList,ReversingList,
HandlingList,SlicingList,
HandlingList,ListReferencing,"ListReferencing refers to the code in which one list is set equal to another, and a change to one of the lists causes the same change in the other list. ListReferencing should only be marked as present if a list is explicitly assigned to another list variable (e.g., list2 = list1)."
