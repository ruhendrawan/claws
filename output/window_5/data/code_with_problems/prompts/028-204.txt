Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

HandlingStandardFunction,DefiningStandardFunction,"DefiningStandardFunction refers to defining a function that: 1) Does not call any other user-defined functions 2) Is not nested inside another function 3) Does not call itself (not recursive) Note: A standard function may still call built-in functions. Additionally, DefiningStandardFunction can still be later called in nested patterns (NestedFunctionCall)."
HandlingStandardFunction,CallingStandardFunction,CallingStandardFunction refers to calling a function that meets all the 3 following criteria:1) Does not call any other user-defined functions 2) Is not nested inside another function 3) Does not call itself (not recursive) Note: A standard function may still call built-in functions.

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_concat_char_two_str
#problem description: Construct a program that has a function that receives two strings and returns a string formed from the given strings such that the first character of each string is omitted. For example, the new string that will be formed from the strings 'abc' and 'xyz' is 'bcyz'. Assume that both strings have at least one character.
#Step 1: Define the function
def concat_chars(a, b):
    return a[1:] + b[1:]
#Step 2: Call the function
print(concat_chars("Hello", "There"))
```
