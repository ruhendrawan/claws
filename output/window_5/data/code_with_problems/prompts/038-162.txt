Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_adjacent_greater
#problem description: Construct a program that checks whether a sequence of non-zero numbers, entered one at a time, contains adjacent numbers in ascending order. Numbers are said to be in ascending order when they are arranged from the smallest to the largest number. For example, 5, 9, 13, 17 and 21 are arranged in ascending order. Note that you need to think what value should the program use to indicate the end of the input.
#Step 1: Read the first number that the user enters
text = input("Enter a number: ")
num = float(text)
#Step 2: Read the rest of the numbers that the user enters and check for adjacent numbers in ascending order
while num != 0 :
    previous = num
    text = input("Enter a number: ")
    num = float(text)
    if num != 0 and num > previous :
        print(previous,"and", num, "are in ascending order.")
