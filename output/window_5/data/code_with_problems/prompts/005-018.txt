## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_str_repeat_chars
#problem description: Construct a program that has a function that receives a string and creates a new string that has each character of the given string repeated two times. For example, the new string that will be formed from the string 'abc' is 'aabbcc'.
#Step 1: Define the function
def double_char(s):
    #Step 1.1: Assign initial value to the variable that we need for the new string
    new_s = ""
    #Step 1.2: Iterate through the characters in the given string
    for char in s:
        #Step 1.2.1: Add the repeated character to the the new string
        new_s += char * 2
    #String 1.3: Print the new string
    print(new_s)
#Step 2: Call the function
double_char("Hi There")
