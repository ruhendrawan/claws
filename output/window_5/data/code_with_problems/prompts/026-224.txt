You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_stars_2
#problem description: An inverted right triangle star pattern of N rows contains N-i+1 asterisks in the i-th row. Construct a program that receives the number of rows in the inverted right triangle star pattern and prints that triangle. For example, when the number of rows in the inverted right triangle star pattern is 5, the program prints the following output:
#*****
#****
#***
#**
#*
#Step 1: Read the number of rows in the inverted right triangle star pattern
N = int(input("Enter the number of rows in the inverted right triangle star pattern:"))
#Step 2: Print the rows in the star pattern, one by one
for i in range(1, N+1):
    #Step 2.1: Generate the asterisks in the i-th row
    row = ""
    for j in range(1, N-i+2):
        row = row + "*"
    #Step 2.2: Print the asterisks in the i-th row
    print(row)
```
