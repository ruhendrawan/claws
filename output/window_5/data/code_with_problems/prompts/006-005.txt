Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_phone_age2
#problem description : Construct a program that determines whether it is time to buy a new phone based on the inputs that it receives from the user. A new phone should be bought in either of the following cases: the phone break, the screen has a problem, the phone has the random shutdown problem
#Step 1: Read the user input for determining whether the phone is broken
text = input("Enter 1 if the phone is broken, otherwise enter 0:")
input_num = int(text)
#Step 2: Determine whether the phone is broken
if input_num == 1 :
    is_broken = True
else:
    is_broken = False
#Step 3: Read the user input for determining whether the phone screen is good
text = input("Enter 1 if the phone screen is good, otherwise enter 0:")
input_num = int(text)
#Step 4: Determine whether the phone screen is good
if input_num == 1 :
    screen_is_good = True
else:
    screen_is_good = False
#Step 5: Read the user input for determining whether the phone has random shutdown problem
text = input("Enter 1 if the phone has the random shutdown problem, otherwise enter 0:")
input_num = int(text)
#Step 6: Determine whether the phone has random shutdown problem
if input_num == 1 :
    random_shutdown = True
else:
    random_shutdown = False
#Step 7: Write the boolean expression to determine whether it is time to buy a new phone
need_phone = is_broken or not screen_is_good or random_shutdown
#Step 8: Print the result
if need_phone == True :
    print("Yes! It is time to buy a new phone.")
else:
    print("No! It is not yet the time to buy a new phone.")
