You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
HandlingTuple,IndexingTuple,
HandlingList,ReplacingListElement,list[index]= value
HandlingList,ReversingList,
HandlingList,SlicingList,
HandlingList,ListReferencing,"ListReferencing refers to the code in which one list is set equal to another, and a change to one of the lists causes the same change in the other list. ListReferencing should only be marked as present if a list is explicitly assigned to another list variable (e.g., list2 = list1)."
```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ae
#exercise name: ae_python_split
def main():
  values = "45,23,67"
  my_list = values.split(",")
  if len(my_list) > 0:
    biggest = int(my_list[0])
    sum = 0
    for value in my_list:
      value = int(value)
      sum = sum + value
      if value > biggest:
        biggest = value
      print("Sum is:", sum)
    print("The biggest is:", biggest)
  else:
