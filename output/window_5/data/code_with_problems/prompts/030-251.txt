You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
HandlingTuple,IndexingTuple,
HandlingList,ReplacingListElement,list[index]= value
HandlingList,ReversingList,
HandlingList,SlicingList,
HandlingList,ListReferencing,"ListReferencing refers to the code in which one list is set equal to another, and a change to one of the lists causes the same change in the other list. ListReferencing should only be marked as present if a list is explicitly assigned to another list variable (e.g., list2 = list1)."
```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_conditionals_temperature
#problem description: Construct a program that prints out 'Cold', when the temperature is 15 degrees celcius or below, 'Moderate' when it is over 15 degrees but no more than 25 degrees, and 'Hot' when the temperature is over 25 degrees.
if temperature <= 15:
    print("Cold")
elif temperature > 15:
    if temperature <= 25:
        print("Moderate")
    else:
        print("Hot")
