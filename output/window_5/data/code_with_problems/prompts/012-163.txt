Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)

```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_win_percentage
#problem description: Construct a program that receives from the user the number of games that a sports team won in a tournament of 12 games and calculates the winning percentage of that sports team. The program must ask for the number of the games won until the user enters a valid number.
#Step 1: Assign initial values to the variables which we need for this program
total_games = 12
#Step 2: Read the number that the user enters
text = input("Enter the number of games that the sports team won in the tournament: ")
wins = int(text)
#Step 3: Validate the user input, ask for a valid input as long as the user enters an invalid number; otherwise stop
while wins < 0 or wins > total_games :
    text = input("Enter the number of games that the sports team won in the tournament: ")
    wins = int(text)
#Step 4: Calculate and print the percentage of games won by a team
ratio = wins / total_games
print("Winning percentage:", ratio)
