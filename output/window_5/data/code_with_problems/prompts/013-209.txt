Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_str_count2
#problem description: Construct a program that has a function that receives a string and returns the number of times that the string "hi?t" appears anywhere in the given string where '?' could be any letter. For example, "hint" and "hilt" would count as a match. All string comparisons should be case-insensitive.
#Step 1: Define the function
def count_hi(s):
    #Step 1.1: Assign initial value to the variable that we need for the counts
    count = 0
    #Step 1.2: Iterate through the characters in the given string
    for i in range(len(s)-3):
        #Step 1.2.1: Increment the counts by 1 if we find a match
        if s[i:i+2].lower() == "hi" and s[i+3].lower() == "t":
            count += 1
    #Step 1.3: Return the counts
    return count
#Step 2: Call the function
print(count_hi("hiatc?Hi ho hIx"))
```
