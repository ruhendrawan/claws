#problem description: First define a calculate function and then define double function (that returns the given value doubled). Then write a program that first prints out 20 and then 36.
def calculate(first, second):
    return second * 3 + first
def double(value):
    return value * 2
print(double(double(5)))
print(calculate(double(3), 2 + calculate(5, 1)))
