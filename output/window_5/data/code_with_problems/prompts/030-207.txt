Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
HandlingTuple,IndexingTuple,
HandlingList,ReplacingListElement,list[index]= value
HandlingList,ReversingList,
HandlingList,SlicingList,
HandlingList,ListReferencing,"ListReferencing refers to the code in which one list is set equal to another, and a change to one of the lists causes the same change in the other list. ListReferencing should only be marked as present if a list is explicitly assigned to another list variable (e.g., list2 = list1)."
```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_str_repeat
#problem description: Construct a program that has a function that receives a string and creates a new string that has every other character of the given string, starting with the first character, repeated two times. For example, the new string that will be formed from the string 'abcde' is 'aaccee'.
#Step 1: Define the function
def double_char(s):
    #Step 1.1: Assign initial value to the variable that we need for the new string
    new_s = ""
    #Step 1.2: Iterate through every other characters in the given string
    for i in range(0, len(s), 2) :
        #Step 1.2.1: Add the repeated character to the the new string
        new_s += s[i] * 2
    #String 1.3: Print the new string
    print(new_s)
#Step 2: Call the function
double_char("Hi There")
