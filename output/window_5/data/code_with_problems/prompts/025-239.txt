Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

WhileLoopWithUpdate,WhileLoopWith+=,WhileLoopWith+= refers to when there is an update of a variable with the addition sign inside a while loop
WhileLoopWithUpdate,WhileLoopWith*=,WhileLoopWith*= refers to when there is an update of a variable with the multiplication sign inside a while loop

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_nested_calls
#problem description: First define a calculate function and then define double function (that returns the given value doubled). Then write a program that first prints out 20 and then 36.
def calculate(first, second):
    return second * 3 + first
def double(value):
    return value * 2
print(double(double(5)))
print(calculate(double(3), 2 + calculate(5, 1)))
