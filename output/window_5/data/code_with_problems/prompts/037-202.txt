Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_check_product_code
#problem description: Suppose a hypothetical company uses codes to represent its various products. A product code includes, among other information, a character in the tenth position that represents the zone from which that product was made. Due to some reorganization, products from zone R are banned from being sold. Construct a program that reads product codes from the user and counts the number of valid and banned codes entered. Make sure that the program handles all possible exceptions. The program must ask the user for an input until the user enters STOP.
#Step 1: Define the function
def check_product_code():
    #Step 1.1: Assign initial values to the variables that we need for counts
    valid = 0
    banned = 0
    #Step 1.2: Ask for a valid input as long as the user does'nt enter STOP; otherwise stop
    code = input("Enter product code: ")
    while ( code != "STOP") :
        #Step 1.2.1: Enclose the code that might throw an exception within the try block
        try :
            zone = code[9]
            valid += 1
            if zone == "R" :
                banned += 1
        #Step 1.2.2: Handle all possible exceptions that may be thrown in the try block
        except IndexError :
            print("Improper code length.")
        code = input("Enter product code: ")
    #Step 1.3: Print the result
    print("# of valid codes entered:", valid)
    print("# of banned codes entered:", banned)
#Step 2: Call the function
check_product_code()
