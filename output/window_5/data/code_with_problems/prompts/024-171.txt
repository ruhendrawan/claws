Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_list2d_basic3 
#problem description: Construct a program that initializes a 2x4 two-dimensional matrix that has multiples of 10 from 10 to 80 for entries, updates the last row to a list holding values 1,3,5,7, then sets the second element of the first row to be 8, and finally prints the matrix.
#Step 1: Define a 2x4 two-dimensional list
matrix = [[ 10, 20, 30, 40 ],
        [ 50, 60, 70, 80 ]]
#Step 2: Update the two-dimensional list
matrix[1] = [1, 3, 5, 7]
matrix[0][1] = 8
#Step 3: Print the list
print(matrix)
