Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

WhileLoopWithUpdate,WhileLoopWith+=,WhileLoopWith+= refers to when there is an update of a variable with the addition sign inside a while loop
WhileLoopWithUpdate,WhileLoopWith*=,WhileLoopWith*= refers to when there is an update of a variable with the multiplication sign inside a while loop

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_time_conversion
#problem description: Construct a program that obtains minutes and remaining seconds from the input amount of time in seconds. For example, 500 seconds contains 8 minutes and 20 seconds.
#Step 1: Read the seconds
text = input("Enter an integer for seconds: ")
seconds = int(text)
#Step 2: Obtain minutes and remaining seconds from the input seconds
minutes = seconds // 60
remaining_seconds = seconds % 60
#Step 3: Display the result
print(seconds , "seconds is" , minutes , "minutes and" , remaining_seconds , "seconds.")
