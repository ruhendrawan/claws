Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

ForLoopWithUpdate,ForLoopWithListIndexing,ForLoopWithListIndexing refers to when there is an indexing of a list happening inside a for  loop
ForLoopWithUpdate,ForLoopWith+=,ForLoopWith+= refers to when there is an update of a variable with the addition sign inside a for loop
HandlingFunction,CallingFunctionLibrary,"CallingFunctionLibrary refers to ANY use of built-in Python functions (print, len, replace, etc.) and built-in methods of objects (like list.append() or string.replace(), etc.)."
HandlingFunction,NestedFunctionCall,"NestedFunctionCall refers to when one function call is placed as an argument to another function call (e.g., f(g(x)))"
HandlingNestedFunction,CallingNestedFunction,CallingNestedFunction refers to the call of functions that have in their code the definition of other user-defined functions

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_average_list_elements 
#problem description: Construct a program that has a function that receives a list and calculates the average of the values in that list. The program should handle lists with arbitrary number of values (including an empty list).
#Step 1: Define the function
def calculate_list_average(lst):
    #Step 1.1: Assign initial value to the variable which we need for this program
    total = 0
    #Step 1.2: Iterate through the list values and add each value to the running total
    for x in lst:
        total += x
    #Step 1.3: Calculate and print the average of the list values
    if len(lst) == 0 :
        print("The list has no values.")
    else :
        average = total / len(lst)
        print("Average is:", average)
#Step 2: Call the function
values = [6, 15, 9, 12, 1, 8]
calculate_list_average(values)
