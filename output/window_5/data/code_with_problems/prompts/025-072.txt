You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

WhileLoopWithUpdate,WhileLoopWith+=,WhileLoopWith+= refers to when there is an update of a variable with the addition sign inside a while loop
WhileLoopWithUpdate,WhileLoopWith*=,WhileLoopWith*= refers to when there is an update of a variable with the multiplication sign inside a while loop

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_display_time2
#problem description: Construct a program that obtains hours, minutes, and seconds from an amount of time in milliseconds.
#Step 1: Read the milliseconds
text = input("Enter the milliseconds: ")
milliseconds = int(text)
#Step 2: Obtain hours, minutes, and seconds from the milliseconds
total_secs = milliseconds // 1000
hours = total_secs // 3600
mins = ( total_secs // 60 ) % 60
secs = total_secs % 60
#Step 3: Display the result
print(milliseconds, "milliseconds is", hours, "hours and" , mins , "minutes and" , secs , "seconds.")
