Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
BuiltInFunction,min(),
BuiltInFunction,list(),
BuiltInFunction,open(),

```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_dict_values
#problem description: Construct a program that prints out how many items in total are in storage. You can assume that a dictionary called storage has already been initialized.
total_items = 0
for item_count in storage.values():
    total_items += item_count
print(total_items)
