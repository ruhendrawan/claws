## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_str_count
#problem description: Construct a program that has a function that receives a string and returns the number of times that the string "hi" appears anywhere in the given string, ignoring the case.
#Step 1: Define the function
def count_hi(s):
    #Step 1.1: Assign initial value to the variable that we need for the counts
    count = 0
    #Step 1.2: Iterate through the characters in the given string
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        #Step 1.2.1: Increment the counts by 1 if we find a match
        if s[i:i+2].lower() == "hi":
            count += 1
    #Step 1.3: Return the counts
    return count
#Step 2: Call the function
print(count_hi("hiabc Hi ho hIx"))
