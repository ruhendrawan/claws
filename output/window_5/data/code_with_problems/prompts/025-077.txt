You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

WhileLoopWithUpdate,WhileLoopWith+=,WhileLoopWith+= refers to when there is an update of a variable with the addition sign inside a while loop
WhileLoopWithUpdate,WhileLoopWith*=,WhileLoopWith*= refers to when there is an update of a variable with the multiplication sign inside a while loop

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_f_to_c_conversion
#problem description: Construct a program that computes the Fahrenheit equivalent of an input Celsius value using the formula F = (9/5)C + 32. The input Celsius value is an integer.
#Step 1: Assign initial values to the variables which we need for this program
base = 32
conversion_factor = 9 / 5
#Step 2: Read the input Celsius value
text = input("Enter the Celsius value: ")
celsius_temp = int(text)
#Step 3: Compute the  Fahrenheit equivalent of the Celsius value
fahrenheit_temp = celsius_temp * conversion_factor + base
print("Celsius Temperature:" , celsius_temp)
print("Fahrenheit Equivalent:" , fahrenheit_temp)
