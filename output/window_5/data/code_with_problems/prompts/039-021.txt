Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_input_stat2
#problem description:  Construct a program that receives the full path to an input file from the user, reads that file and reports the number of lines, the longest line, the number of words on each line, and the length of the longest word on each line. Make sure that the program handles each specific exception that could occur. Also, the program must ask the user for a valid file path until the user enters a file path that could be accessed without any exception.
#Step 1: Define the function that gets the valid file path
def get_file():
    valid = False
    while not valid :
        try:
            file_name = input("Enter the full path of a file: ")
            myfile = open( file_name, "r")
            myfile.close()
            valid = True
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print("File not found.")
        except IOError:
            print("Problem with the file!")
    return file_name
#Step 2: Define the function that processes the file
def get_stat(file_name):
    #Step 2.1: Assign initial value to variable that we need for reporting the file information
    num_lines = 0
    longest_line = ""
    #Step 2.2: Enclose the code that might throw an exception within the try block
    try :
        #Step 2.2.1: Open the file and process each line in the file
        myfile = open( file_name, "r")
        for line in myfile:
            num_lines += 1
            num_words = len(line.split())
            #Determine if the line is the longest line so far
            if (len(line) > len(longest_line)) :
                longest_line = line
            #Find the length of the longest word in the line
            longest_word = 0
            for w in line.split() :
                if len(w) > longest_word :
                    longest_word = len(w)
            #Print the line information
            print("Line " + str(num_lines) + " has " + str(num_words) + " tokens (longest = " + str(longest_word) + ")")
        print("Longest line:" + longest_line)
        #Step 2.2.2: Close the file
        myfile.close()
    #Step 2.3: Handle all possible exceptions that may be thrown in the try block
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("File not found.")
    except IOError:
        print("Problem with the file!")
#Step 3: Call the functions
get_stat( get_file() )
