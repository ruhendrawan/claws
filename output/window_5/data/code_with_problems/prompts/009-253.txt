You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
ComparisonOperator,Larger,>
ComparisonOperator,LargerOrEqual,>=
ComparisonOperator,Less,<
ComparisonOperator,NotEqual,!=
MembershipOperator,in,maybe delete this one actually
```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: ps
#exercise name: ps_python_try_except
#problem description: Construct a program that prints out various Celcius temperatures in Fahrenheit.
def centigrade_to_fahrenheit(temp):
    try:
        if temp < -273.15:
            raise ValueError("Temperature below absolute zero!")
        return temp*1.8+32
    except ValueError:
        print("Temperature set impossibly low!")
print(centigrade_to_fahrenheit(temp_to_convert))
```
