Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_file_input_stat
#problem description:  Construct a program that receives the full path to an input file from the user, reads that file and reports the number of lines, the longest line, the number of words on each line, and the length of the longest word on each line. Make sure that the program handles each specific exception that could occur.
#Step 1: Define the function
def get_stat(file_name):
    #Step 1.1: Assign initial value to variable that we need for reporting the file information
    num_lines = 0
    longest_line = ""
    #Step 1.2: Enclose the code that might throw an exception within the try block
    try :
        #Step 1.2.1: Open the file and process each line in the file
        myfile = open( file_name, "r")
        for line in myfile:
            num_lines += 1
            num_words = len(line.split())
            #Determine if the line is the longest line so far
            if (len(line) > len(longest_line)) :
                longest_line = line
            #Find the length of the longest word in the line
            longest_word = 0
            for w in line.split() :
                if len(w) > longest_word :
                    longest_word = len(w)
            #Print the line information
            print("Line " + str(num_lines) + " has " + str(num_words) + " tokens (longest = " + str(longest_word) + ")")
        print("Longest line:" + longest_line)
        #Step 1.2.2: Close the file
        myfile.close()
    #Step 1.3: Handle all possible exceptions that may be thrown in the try block
