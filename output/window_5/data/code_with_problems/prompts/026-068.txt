You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_concat_str_num
#problem description: Construct a program that uses variables x, y, and z to print "Python was invented in 1989.".
#Step 1: Assign initial values to the variables x, y, and z
x = "Python was invented in "
y = 1989
z = "."
#Step 2: Print the text using the variables initialized above
print(x + str(y) + z)
```
