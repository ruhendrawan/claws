Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

HandlingNestedFunction,DefiningNestedFunction,DefiningNestedFunction refers to defining a function inside another user-defined function.
HandlingFunctionCallingFunction,DefiningFunctionCallingFunction,
HandlingFunctionCallingFunction,CallingFunctionCallingFunction,
HandlingStandardFunction,DefiningStandardFunction,"DefiningStandardFunction refers to defining a function that: 1) Does not call any other user-defined functions 2) Is not nested inside another function 3) Does not call itself (not recursive) Note: A standard function may still call built-in functions. Additionally, DefiningStandardFunction can still be later called in nested patterns (NestedFunctionCall)."
HandlingStandardFunction,CallingStandardFunction,CallingStandardFunction refers to calling a function that meets all the 3 following criteria:1) Does not call any other user-defined functions 2) Is not nested inside another function 3) Does not call itself (not recursive) Note: A standard function may still call built-in functions.

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_nested_if_temperature
#problem description: Construct a program that receives the temperature for today and yesterday and warns the user when it is getting colder or warmer or neither. The temperature values could have a decimal point.
#Step 1: Read the temperature for today and yesterday
text = input("Enter the yesterday's temperature: ")
yesterday = float(text)
text = input("Enter the today's temperature: ")
today = float(text)
#Step 2: Warn the user about the changes in the temperature
if  today < yesterday :
    print("It is getting colder!")
else :
    if  today > yesterday :
        print("It is getting warmer!")
    else :
        print("Temperature is the same as yesterday!")
