Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

#problem description: Construct a program that determines whether an integer is positive, negative, or zero.
#Step 1: Read the integer
text = input("Enter an integer: ")
num = int(text)
#Step 2: Determine whether the integer is positive, negative, or zero
if num > 0 :
