You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_write_squares_range
#problem description: Construct a program to write out the squares of every number between 20 and 25, both inclusive.
#Step 1: Iterate through the numbers in the sequence
for num in range(20, 26):
    #Step 1.1: Square and print each number in the sequence
    print(num, "squared =", num * num)
