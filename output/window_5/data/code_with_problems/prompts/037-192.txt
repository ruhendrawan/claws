Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_soda_survey
#problem description: Suppose a soda manufacturer held a taste test for four new flavors to determine if people liked them. The manufacturer got 10 people to try each new flavor and give it a score from 1 to 5, where 1 equals poor and 5 equals excellent. The results of that survey is stored in a matrix. Each row of the matrix holds the responses that all testers gave for one particular soda flavor, and each column holds the responses of one person for all sodas. Construct a program that determines the maximum rating that each of the four new flavors of soda received.
#Step 1: Define a 4x10 two-dimensional list
ratings_data = [[3, 4, 5, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 4, 4],
                [2, 4, 3, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2],
                [3, 5, 4, 5, 5, 3, 2, 5, 5, 5],
                [1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4]]
#Step 2: Get the dimensions of the list that stores the ratings data
num_sodas = len(ratings_data)
num_respondents = len(ratings_data[0])
#Step 3: Create a list to store the maximum rating of each soda flavor
soda_max = [0] * num_sodas
#Step 4: Iterate through the sodas
for i in range(num_sodas):
    #Step 4.1: Find the maximum rating of soda i+1 by iterating through its ratings
    for j in range(num_respondents):
        if ratings_data[i][j] > soda_max[i] :
            soda_max[i] = ratings_data[i][j]
#Step 5: Print the maximum rating for each soda
print("Maximums:")
for i in range(num_sodas):
    print("Soda # {:d} : {:d}".format((i+1), soda_max[i]))
