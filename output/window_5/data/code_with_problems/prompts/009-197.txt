Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
ComparisonOperator,Larger,>
ComparisonOperator,LargerOrEqual,>=
ComparisonOperator,Less,<
ComparisonOperator,NotEqual,!=
MembershipOperator,in,maybe delete this one actually
```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_digits
#problem description: Construct a program that prints the digits of an integer from right to left.
#Step 1: Assign initial values to the variables which we need for this program
num = 1234
#Step 2: Print the digits of the integer from right to left
while num > 0 :
    #Step 2.1: Get the last digit in the integer
    last_digit = num % 10
    #Step 2.2: Print the extracted digit
    print(last_digit)
    #Step 2.3: Remove the last digit from the integer
    num = num // 10
