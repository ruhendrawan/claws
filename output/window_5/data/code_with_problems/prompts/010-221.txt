## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_repeated_sequence
#problem description: Construct a program that receives an integer N from the user and prints a sequence of space-separated numbers from 1 to N such that each number in the sequence is repeated 5 times.
#Step 1: Read the integer N that the user enters
N = int(input("Enter the integer N: "))
#Step 2: Print N space-separated numbers
for i in range(1, N+1):
    #Step 2.1: Print the i-th number five times
    for j in range(1, 6):
        print(i)
