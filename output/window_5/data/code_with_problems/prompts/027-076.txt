## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_pythagorean_theorem2
#problem description: Suppose that the user provides two input values for a right-angle triangle. The first input is for the length of an adjacent side in the triangle and the second input is for the hypotenuse of that triangle. The program calculates the second adjacent side of the triangle using these two input values. Use the Pythagorean theorem (c^2 = a^2 + b^2) to find the length of the second adjacent side.
#Step 1: Receive the values for the first side of a right-angle triangle and the hypotenuse
text = input("Enter the length of side A:")
side_A = float(text)
text = input("Enter the length of the hypotenuse:")
hypotenuse = float(text)
#Step 2: Calculate square of side A
square_side_A = side_A ** 2
#Step 3: Calculate square of hypotenuse
square_hypotenuse = hypotenuse ** 2
#Step 4: Use Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of the triangle's other adjacent side
side_B = (square_hypotenuse - square_side_A) ** 0.5
#Step 5: Print the result
print("Given that side A is", side_A, "and the hypotenuse is", hypotenuse, ", side B is", side_B)
