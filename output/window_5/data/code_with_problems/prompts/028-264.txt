Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

HandlingNestedFunction,DefiningNestedFunction,DefiningNestedFunction refers to defining a function inside another user-defined function.
HandlingFunctionCallingFunction,DefiningFunctionCallingFunction,
HandlingFunctionCallingFunction,CallingFunctionCallingFunction,
HandlingStandardFunction,DefiningStandardFunction,"DefiningStandardFunction refers to defining a function that: 1) Does not call any other user-defined functions 2) Is not nested inside another function 3) Does not call itself (not recursive) Note: A standard function may still call built-in functions. Additionally, DefiningStandardFunction can still be later called in nested patterns (NestedFunctionCall)."
HandlingStandardFunction,CallingStandardFunction,CallingStandardFunction refers to calling a function that meets all the 3 following criteria:1) Does not call any other user-defined functions 2) Is not nested inside another function 3) Does not call itself (not recursive) Note: A standard function may still call built-in functions.
