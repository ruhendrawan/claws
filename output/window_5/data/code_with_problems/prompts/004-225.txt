Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
DictionaryMethod,keys(),
DictionaryMethod,values(),
FileMethod,readline(),
FileMethod,read(),
FileMethod,close(),
```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_divisor
#problem description: Construct a program that finds the smallest divisor (other than 1) of a positive number. For example, the smallest divisor of 4 is 2.
#Step 1: Assign initial values to the variables which we need for this program
num = 15
divisor = 2
#Step 2: Find the smallest divisor of the number
while num % divisor != 0 :
    divisor += 1
print("The smallest divisor of", num, "is", divisor)
```
