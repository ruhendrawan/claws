Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_phone_age
#Step 1: Read the user inputs
#problem description : Construct a program that determines whether it is time to buy a new phone based on the inputs that it receives from the user. A new phone should be bought if the phone breaks or the phone is at least 3 years old.
text = input("Enter the phone age in years:")
phone_age = int(text)
text = input("Enter 1 if the phone is broken, otherwise enter 0:")
input_num = int(text)
#Step 2: Determine whether the phone is broken
if input_num == 1 :
    is_broken = True
else:
    is_broken = False
#Step 3: Write the boolean expression to determine whether it is time to buy a new phone
need_phone = is_broken or phone_age >= 3
#Step 4: Print the result
if need_phone == True :
    print("Yes! It is time to buy a new phone.")
else:
    print("No! It is not yet the time to buy a new phone.")
