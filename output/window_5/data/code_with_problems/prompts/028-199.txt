Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

HandlingStandardFunction,DefiningStandardFunction,"DefiningStandardFunction refers to defining a function that: 1) Does not call any other user-defined functions 2) Is not nested inside another function 3) Does not call itself (not recursive) Note: A standard function may still call built-in functions. Additionally, DefiningStandardFunction can still be later called in nested patterns (NestedFunctionCall)."
HandlingStandardFunction,CallingStandardFunction,CallingStandardFunction refers to calling a function that meets all the 3 following criteria:1) Does not call any other user-defined functions 2) Is not nested inside another function 3) Does not call itself (not recursive) Note: A standard function may still call built-in functions.

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name:py_reverse_number
#problem description: Construct a program that reverses the digits of an integer mathematically. 
#Step 1: Assign initial values to the variables which we need for this program
num = 1234
reverse = 0
#Step 2: Reverse the digits of the integer mathematically
while num > 0 :
    #Step 2.1: Get the last digit in the integer
    last_digit = num % 10
    #Step 2.2:?Append the last digit to reverse
    reverse = (reverse * 10) + last_digit
    #Step 2.3: Remove the last digit from the integer
    num = num // 10
    print("last digit:", last_digit, ", reverse:", reverse, ", integer:", num)
print("The reversed integer is:", reverse)
