You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
HandlingTuple,IndexingTuple,
HandlingList,ReplacingListElement,list[index]= value
HandlingList,ReversingList,
HandlingList,SlicingList,
HandlingList,ListReferencing,"ListReferencing refers to the code in which one list is set equal to another, and a change to one of the lists causes the same change in the other list. ListReferencing should only be marked as present if a list is explicitly assigned to another list variable (e.g., list2 = list1)."
```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_ifelseif_grade2
#problem description: Construct a program that receives a grade from the user and prints the numeric range for that grade using the following grading rules: A for scores ≥ 90, B for scores ≥ 80, C for scores ≥ 70, D for scores ≥ 60, F for scores < 60, For example, if the user enters the grade D, the program prints "Score is in range [60-70)". 
#Step 1: Read the letter grade
grade = input("Enter a grade letter in uppercase: ")
#Step 2: Determine and print the numeric range for the input letter grade
if grade == "A" :
    print("Score is greater than or equal 90.")
elif grade == "B" :
    print("Score is in range [80-90).")
elif grade == "C" :
    print("Score is in range [70-80).")
elif grade == "D" :
    print("Score is in range [60-70).")
else :
    print("Score is below 60.")
```
