Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
ComparisonOperator,Larger,>
ComparisonOperator,LargerOrEqual,>=
ComparisonOperator,Less,<
ComparisonOperator,NotEqual,!=
MembershipOperator,in,maybe delete this one actually
```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: q_py
#exercise name: q_py_topic_loops:q_py_while_loop2
n = 5
i = 1
a = 0
b = 1
print(b)
while i < n:
    c = a + b
    print(c)
    a = b
    b = c
    i = i + 1
```
