## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_bmi_calculator
#problem description: BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. BMI Categories are as follows:Underweight = <18.5, Normal weight = 18.5–24.9, Overweight = 25–29.9, Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater., English BMI Formula (Imperial) is: BMI = (Weight in Pounds / (Height in inches x Height in inches)) x 703., Construct a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) according to this formula.
#Step 1: Receive the weight and height from the user
text = input("Enter the weight in pounds:")
weight = float(text)
text = input("Enter the height in inches:")
height = float(text)
#Step 2: Calculate BMI
bmi = weight / height ** 2 * 703
#Step 3: Print the result
print("The BMI is:", bmi)
```
