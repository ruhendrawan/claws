Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
HandlingTuple,IndexingTuple,
HandlingList,ReplacingListElement,list[index]= value
HandlingList,ReversingList,
HandlingList,SlicingList,
HandlingList,ListReferencing,"ListReferencing refers to the code in which one list is set equal to another, and a change to one of the lists causes the same change in the other list. ListReferencing should only be marked as present if a list is explicitly assigned to another list variable (e.g., list2 = list1)."

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_write_squares_range
#problem description: Construct a program to write out the squares of every number between 20 and 25, both inclusive.
#Step 1: Iterate through the numbers in the sequence

    #Step 1.1: Square and print each number in the sequence
    print(num, "squared =", num * num)
