You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
WhileLoopWithUpdate,WhileLoopWithListIndexing,WhileLoopWithListIndexing refers to when there is an indexing of a list happening inside a while loop
NestedLoopIteration,MixedNestedLoopIteration,MixedNestedLoopIteration refers to nested loop such that a while-loop inside a for-loop or a for-loop inside a while-loop
NestedLoopIteration,NestedWhileLoopIteration,NestedWhileLoopIteration refers to nested loop such that a while-loop is inside another while-loop
NestedLoopIteration,NestedForLoopIteration,NestedForLoopIteration refers to nested loop such that  a for-loop is inside another for-loop

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_list_min
#problem description: Write a program that finds the minimum value in a list.
#Step 1: Define and initialize the list
values = [5, 8, 4, 78, 95, 12, 1, 0, 6, 35, 46]
#Step 2: Set the first value to be the minimum value so far.
min_value = values[0]
#Step 3: Iterate through the remaining values in the list and decide which one is the minimum value
for i in range(1, len(values)):
    # Step 3.1: Determine if the element at index i is the minimum value so far
    if (values[i] < min_value):
        min_value = values[i]
#Step 4: Print the minimum value in the list
print("Minimum value:", min_value)
