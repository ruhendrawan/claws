Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_win_percentage_input
#problem description: Construct a program that receives from the user the number of games in a tournament and the number of the games that a sports team won in the tournament, and calculates the winning percentage of that sports team. The program must ask the user for each of the two inputs until the user enters a valid number.
#Step 1: Read the number of games in the tournament
text = input("Enter the number of games in the tournament: ")
total_games = int(text)
#Step 2: Validate the user input for the number of games in the tournament, ask for a valid input as long as the user enters an invalid number; otherwise stop
while total_games <= 0 :
    text = input("Enter the number of games in the tournament: ")
    total_games = int(text)
#Step 3: Read the number of games that the sports team won in the tournament
text = input("Enter the number of games that the sports team won in the tournament: ")
wins = int(text)
#Step 4: Validate the user input for the number of games that the sports team won in the tournament, ask for a valid input as long as the user enters an invalid number; otherwise stop
while wins < 0 or wins > total_games :
    text = input("Enter the number of games that the sports team won in the tournament: ")
    wins = int(text)
#Step 5: Calculate and print the percentage of games won by a team
ratio = wins / total_games
print("Winning percentage:", ratio)
