Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Ontology Classes
```csv(parent,leaf,description)
BuiltInFunction,round(),
BuiltInFunction,dict(),
BuiltInFunction,set(),
BuiltInFunction,int(),
BuiltInFunction,range(),
```

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code

def num(arr):
    total = 0
    letter_len = 0
    for number in arr:

            total += temp
        except TypeError:
