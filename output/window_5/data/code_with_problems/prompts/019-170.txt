## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_list2d_basic2
#problem description: Construct a program that initializes a 3x3 two-dimensional matrix that has the numbers 1 through 9 for entries, updates the middle row to a list filled with 1s, then sets the top-right element of the matrix to be 10, and finally prints the matrix.
#Step 1: Define a 3x3 two-dimensional list
matrix = [[ 1, 2, 3 ],
        [ 4, 5, 6 ],
        [ 7, 8, 9 ]]
#Step 2: Update the two-dimensional list
matrix[1] = [1, 1, 1]
matrix[0][2] = 10
#Step 3: Print the list
print(matrix)
