You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_boolean_dry_hot2
#problem description : Construct a program that determines whether it is either too hot or too dry (or both) based on the inputs that it receives from the user.
#Step 1: Read the user input for determining whether it is too hot
text = input("Enter 1 if it is too hot, otherwise enter 0:")
input_num = int(text)
#Step 2: Determine whether it is too hot
if input_num == 1 :
    too_hot = True
else:
    too_hot = False
#Step 3: Read the user input for determining whether it is too dry
text = input("Enter 1 if it is too dry, otherwise enter 0:")
input_num = int(text)
#Step 4: Determine whether it is too dry
if input_num == 1 :
    too_dry = True
else:
    too_dry = False
#Step 5: Write the boolean expression to determine whether it is either too hot or too dry (or both)
result = too_hot or too_dry
#Step 6: Print the result
if result == True :
    print("Yes! It is either too hot or too dry (or both).")
else:
    print("No! the weather condition 'too hot or too dry (or both)' is not met.")
