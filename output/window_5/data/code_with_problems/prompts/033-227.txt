#problem description: Construct a program that receives an integer from the user, outputs that integer, and stops receiving integers when the user enters a negative integer.
#Step 1: Read the first integer that the user enters
text = input("Enter an integer:")
num = int(text)
#Step 2: Print the integer that the user has entered, then receive the next integers as long as the user enters an integer that is not negative;; otherwise stop
while num >= 0 :
    print("The integer entered is:", num)
    text = input("Enter an integer:")
    num = int(text)
