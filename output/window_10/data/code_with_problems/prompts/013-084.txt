You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_nested_if_temperature2
#problem description: Construct a program that receives the temperature and humidity for today and yesterday and warns the user when it is getting colder or warmer or neither. When it is getting warmer, the program should also warn the user about the changes in humidity. In particular, it should warn the user when today's humidity is more, less, or has not changed compared to yesterday's humidity. Note that the temperature and humidity values could have a decimal point.
#Step 1: Read the temperature for today and yesterday
text = input("Enter the yesterday's temperature: ")
yesterday = float(text)
text = input("Enter the today's temperature: ")
today = float(text)
#Step 2: Read the humidity for today and yesterday
text = input("Enter yesterday's humidity: ")
humidity_yesterday = float(text)
text = input("Enter today's humidity: ")
humidity_today = float(text)
#Step 3: Warn the user about the changes in the temperature
if today < yesterday :
    print("It is getting colder!")
else :
    if today > yesterday :
        #Step 3.1: Determine and warn the user about the changes in humidity when it is getting warmer
        if humidity_today < humidity_yesterday :
            print("It is getting warmer but less humid!")
        elif humidity_today > humidity_yesterday :
            print("It is getting warmer and more humid!")
        else :
            print("It is getting warmer but humidity has not changed!")
    else :
        print("Temperature is the same as yesterday!")
