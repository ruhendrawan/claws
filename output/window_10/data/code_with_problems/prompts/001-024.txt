## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: bjects_classes_loan
#problem description: Construct a class that represents a loan. This class should contain data representing the interest rate, loan amount, and the length of loan period (in years); all of which could be accessed or changed only through the getter and setter methods. An instance of the class should be created by specifying annual interest rate, length of loan period, and loan amount. The other method of the this class should calculate the amount of monthly payments on the loan.
#Step 1: Define the class
class Loan1 :
    #Step 1.1: Initialize the loan with the specified values
    def __init__(self, annual_interest_rate, number_of_years, loan_amount) :
        self.__annual_interest_rate = annual_interest_rate
        self.__number_of_years = number_of_years
        self.__loan_amount = loan_amount
    #Step 1.2: Define the method that calculates the amount of monthly payments on the loan
    def get_monthly_payment(self) :
        monthly_interest_rate = self.__annual_interest_rate / 12
        monthly_payment = self.__loan_amount * monthly_interest_rate / (1 -
                (1 / (1 + monthly_interest_rate) ** (self.__number_of_years * 12) ))
        return monthly_payment
    #Step 1.3: Define the methods to get/set the properties of the loan
    def get_annual_interest_rate(self) :
        return self.__annual_interest_rate
    def set_annual_interest_rate(self, annual_interest_rate) :
        self.__annual_interest_rate = annual_interest_rate
    def get_number_of_years(self) :
        return self.__number_of_years
    def set_number_of_years(self, number_of_years) :
        self.__number_of_years = number_of_years
    def get_loan_amount(self) :
        return self.__loan_amount
    def set_loan_amount(self, loan_amount) :
        self.__loan_amount = loan_amount
#Step 2: Test the class
annual_interest_rate = float(input("Enter the annual interest rate: "))
number_of_years = int(input("Enter the number of years for the loan period: "))
loan_amount = (float(input("Enter the loan amount: ")))
loan1 = Loan1(annual_interest_rate, number_of_years, loan_amount)
print("The monthly payment for the loan is: {:.2f} ".format(loan1.get_monthly_payment()))
