Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_point2
#problem description: Construct a class that represents a point in the Euclidean plane. The class should contain data that represents the pointâ€™s integer coordinates (x,y). The point's coordinates could be accessed or changed only through the getter and setter methods. The class should also include a method to calculate and return the point's distance from the origin (0,0).
#Step 1: Define the class
class Point2 :
    #Step 1.1: Declare the method to calculate and return the point's distance from the origin
    def distance_from_origin(self) :
        return (self.__x * self.__x + self.__y * self.__y) ** 0.5
    #Step 1.2: Define the setter and getter methods for the x-coordinate of the point
    def set_x(self, new_x) :
        self.__x = new_x
    def get_x(self) :
        return self.__x
    #Step 1.3: Define the setter and getter methods for the y-coordinate of the point
    def set_y(self, new_y) :
        self.__y = new_y
    def get_y(self) :
        return self.__y
#Step 2: Test the class
p2 = Point2()
p2.set_x(7)
p2.set_y(2)
print("p2 coordinates: (" + str(p2.get_x()) + ", " + str(p2.get_y()) + ")")
print("Distance of p2 from origin = " + str(p2.distance_from_origin()))
