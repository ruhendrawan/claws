Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_list_process_elements
#problem description: Construct a program that has a function that receives a list and calculates the sum of the values in that list.
#Step 1: Define the function
def calculate_list_sum(lst):
    #Step 1.1: Assign initial value to the variable which we need for this program
    total = 0
    #Step 1.2: Iterate through the list values and add each value to the running total
    for x in lst:
        total += x
    #Step 1.3: Print the sum of the list values
    print("The sum of all values in the list:", total)
#Step 2: Call the function
values = [6, 15, 9, 12, 1, 8]
calculate_list_sum(values)
