Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

#exercise type: py
#exercise name: 
# problem description: Construct a class that represents a TV. The class should contain data that represents the TV's state (power on or off, current channel). The state of the TV could be accessed or changed only through the getter and setter methods. The class should also include methods to change the state of the TV (turn on/off, change channels). Assume that the valid channel range is from 1 to 120 (both inclusive).
#Step 1: Define the class
class TV1 :
    #Step 1.1: Initialize the state of the TV
    def __init__(self):
        self.__on = False
        self.__channel = 1
    #Step 1.2: Define the methods to change the on/off state of the TV
    def turn_on(self) :
        self.__on = True
    def turn_off(self) :
        self.__on = False
    #Step 1.3: Define the methods to change the channel of the TV
    def set_channel(self, new_channel) :
        if self.__on and new_channel >= 1 and new_channel <= 120 :
            self.__channel = new_channel
    def channel_up(self) :
        if self.__on and self.__channel < 120 :
            self.__channel += 1
    def channel_down(self) :
        if self.__on and self.__channel > 1 :
            self.__channel -= 1
    #Step 1.4: Define the methods to get the current state of the TV
    def get_channel(self) :
        return self.__channel
    def is_on(self) :
        return self.__on
#Step 2: Test the class
tv1 = TV1()
tv1.turn_on()
tv1.set_channel(30)
tv2 = TV1()
tv2.turn_on()
tv2.channel_up()
tv2.channel_up()
tv2.channel_down()
print("tv1's channel is " + str(tv1.get_channel()))
print("tv2's channel is " + str(tv2.get_channel()))
