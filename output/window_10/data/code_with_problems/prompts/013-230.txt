You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

When identifying nested loop structures, classify the entire structure under the appropriate nested loop category only (e.g., NestedForLoopIteration). Do not also include the single-loop categories for the outer loop"

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_input4
#problem description: Construct a program that receives an integer from the user, outputs that integer, and stops receiving integers when the user enters an even integer less than 10.
#Step 1: Read the first integer that the user enters
text = input("Enter an integer:")
num = int(text)
#Step 2: Print the integer that the user has entered, then receive the next integers as long as the user enters an integer that is not even or is not less than 10; otherwise stop
while num % 2 != 0 or num >= 10 :
    print("The integer entered is:", num)
    text = input("Enter an integer:")
    num = int(text)
print("End of input.")
