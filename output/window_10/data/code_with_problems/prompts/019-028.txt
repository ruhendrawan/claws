Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: objects_classes_point
#problem description : Construct a class that represents a point in the Euclidean plane. The class should contain data that represents the pointâ€™s integer coordinates (x,y). The point's coordinates could be accessed or changed only through the getter and setter methods. The class should also include a method to translate the point, i.e., shift the point's location by the specified amount.
#Step 1: Define the class
class Point1 :
    #Step 1.1: Declare the method to shift the location of the point by the given amount
    def translate(self, dx, dy) :
        self.__x += dx
        self.__y += dy
    #Step 1.2: Define the setter and getter methods for the x-coordinate of the point
    def set_x(self, new_x) :
        self.__x = new_x
    def get_x(self) :
        return self.__x
    #Step 1.3: Define the setter and getter methods for the y-coordinate of the point
    def set_y(self, new_y) :
        self.__y = new_y
    def get_y(self) :
        return self.__y
#Step 2: Test the class
p1 = Point1()
p1.set_x(7)
p1.set_y(2)
p1.translate(11, 6)
print("p1 coordinates: (" + str(p1.get_x()) + ", " + str(p1.get_y()) + ")")
```
