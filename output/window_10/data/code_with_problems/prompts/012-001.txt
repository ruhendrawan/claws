You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_fail_course
# problem description: Construct a program to determine whether a student fails the course based on the inputs that it receives from the instructor. The student fails the course if the exam score is less than 55 or student has more than 2 missing homework.
#Step 1: Read the instructor inputs
text = input("Enter the exam score:")
exam_score = int(text)
text = input("Enter number of missing homework:")
number_of_missing_hw = int(text)
#Step 2: Write the boolean expression to determine whether the student fails the course
is_failing = exam_score < 55 or number_of_missing_hw > 2
#Step 3: Print the result
if is_failing == True :
    print("Yes! The student fails the course.")
else:
    print("No! The student does not fail the course.")
