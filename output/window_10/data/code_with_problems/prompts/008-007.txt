#problem description Construct a program that determines whether a customer could rent a car based on the inputs that it receives from the car rental agent. Rental cars are available to licensed drivers of 21 years of age or over who have not had a car accident.Construct a program that determines whether a customer could rent a car based on the inputs that it receives from the car rental agent. Rental cars are available to licensed drivers of 21 years of age or over who have not had a car accident.
#Step 1: Read the input for the customer's age
text = input("Enter the customer's age:")

#Step 2: Read the input for determining whether the customer has driver's license
