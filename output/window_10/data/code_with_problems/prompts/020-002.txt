Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_fail_course2
#Step 1: Read the instructor inputs
#problem description : Construct a program that determines whether a student fails the course based on the inputs that it receives from the instructor. The student fails the course if the exam score is less than 55 or when the student has cheated. Drag a tile to each missing field to construct this program.
text = input("Enter the exam score:")
exam_score = int(text)
text = input("Enter 1 if the student has cheated, otherwise enter 0:")
input_num = int(text)
#Step 2: Determine whether the student has cheated
if input_num == 1 :
    has_cheated = True
else:
    has_cheated = False
#Step 3: Write the boolean expression to determine whether the student fails the course
is_failing = exam_score < 55 or has_cheated
#Step 4: Print the result
if is_failing == True :
    print("Yes! The student fails the course.")
else:
