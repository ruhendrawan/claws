Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name:py_temperature_list_days_above_threshold
#Problem description : Construct a program that reads a series of temperatures and reports the days that are above 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Assume that the temperature values are in Fahrenheit. Also assume that input values could have a decimal point.
#Step 1: Read the number of days that we have to enter their temperature data
num_days = int(input("Enter the number of temperature values that will be entered: "))
#Step 2: Read the temperature values
temps = []
for i in range(num_days):
    val = float(input("Enter the temperature: "))
    temps.append(val)
#Step 3: Create a list that contains the days that are above 32 degrees Fahrenheit
days_above_32 = []
for i in range(len(temps)) :
    if temps[i] > 32:
        days_above_32.append("Day " + str(i+1))
#Step 4: Print the result
print("Days above 32 degrees Fahrenheit:", days_above_32)
