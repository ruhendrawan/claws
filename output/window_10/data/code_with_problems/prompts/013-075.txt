You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

NonNestedIteration,SingleForLoopIteration,"SingleForLoopIteration refers to a single use use of a for-loop that has no nested structure
When identifying nested loop structures, classify the entire structure under the appropriate nested loop category only (e.g., NestedForLoopIteration). Do not also include the single-loop categories for the outer loop"

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_pythagorean_theorem
#problem description: Construct a program that accepts two input values from the user, one for each side of a right-angle triangle. The program uses the Pythagorean theorem (c^2 = a^2 + b^2) to calculate the length of the triangle's hypotenuse.
#Step 1: Receive the values for each side of a right-angle triangle
text = input("Enter the length of side A:")
side_A = float(text)
text = input("Enter the length of side B:")
side_B = float(text)
#Step 2: Calculate square of side A
squareside_A = side_A ** 2
#Step 3: Calculate square of side B
squareside_B = side_B ** 2
#Step 4: Use Pythagorean theorem to calculate the length of the triangle's hypotenuse
hypotenuse = ( squareside_A + squareside_B ) ** 0.5
#Step 5: Print the result
print("Given that side A is", side_A, "and side B is", side_B, ", the hypotenuse is", hypotenuse)
