Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_list_swap_adjacent_elements
#problem description: Construct a program that swaps pairs of adjacent elements of the list. For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the program will change it to [2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5]. This program assumes that the list has always an even number of elements.
#Step 1: Define and initialize the list
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
#Step 2: Iterate through the pairs of adjacent elements in the list
for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):
    #Step 2.1: Swap the element at index i with the element at index i+1
    temp = lst[i]
    lst[i] = lst[i+1]
    lst[i+1] = temp
#Step 3: Print the list
print(lst)
