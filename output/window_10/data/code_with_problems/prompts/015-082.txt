#problem description: Construct a program that determines the largest of the three integer values entered by the user.
#Step 1: Read the three integers
text = input("Enter the first integer: ")
num1 = int(text)
text = input("Enter the second integer: ")
num2 = int(text)
text = input("Enter the third integer: ")
