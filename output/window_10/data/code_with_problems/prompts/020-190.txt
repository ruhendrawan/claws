## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_search_list_total_count
#problem description: Construct a program that has a function that receives two lists and prints the total number of times the elements in the 2nd list appear in the 1st list. For example, if the 1st list is [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6] and the 2nd list is [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], then the total number of times that the elements in the 2nd list appear in the 1st list is 6. Note that we need to count matches for all values in the 2nd list (including duplicate values, if any).
# Step 1: Define the function
def search_lists(lst1, lst2):
    #Step 1.1: Iterate through the values in the 2nd list
    count = 0
    for val2 in lst2:
        #Step 1.1.1: Iterate through the values in the 1st list
        for val1 in lst1:
            #Step 1.1.1.1: Increment the number of matches if we find a match
            if val2 == val1:
                count += 1
    print("Total number of times the elements in the 2nd list appear in the 1st list is", count)
#Step 2: Call the function
values_1 = [2.0, 11, 11, 4, 5, 3, 3, 3.5, 4, 10, 16]
values_2 =  [7, 11, 3]
search_lists(values_1, values_2)
