You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_list_basic3
#problem description: Construct a program that initializes a list with four string values, changes the last element in the list, and finally, prints the list.
#Step 1: Define a list of four string values
lst = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
#Step 2: Update the list elements
lst[3] = "e"
#Step 3: Print the list
print(lst)
