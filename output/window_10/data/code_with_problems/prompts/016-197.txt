#problem description: Construct a program that prints the digits of an integer from right to left.
#Step 1: Assign initial values to the variables which we need for this program
num = 1234
#Step 2: Print the digits of the integer from right to left
while num > 0 :
    #Step 2.1: Get the last digit in the integer
    last_digit = num % 10
    #Step 2.2: Print the extracted digit
    print(last_digit)
    #Step 2.3: Remove the last digit from the integer
    num = num // 10
