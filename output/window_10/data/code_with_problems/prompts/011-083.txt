## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_nested_if_temperature
#problem description: Construct a program that receives the temperature for today and yesterday and warns the user when it is getting colder or warmer or neither. The temperature values could have a decimal point.
#Step 1: Read the temperature for today and yesterday
text = input("Enter the yesterday's temperature: ")
yesterday = float(text)
text = input("Enter the today's temperature: ")
today = float(text)
#Step 2: Warn the user about the changes in the temperature
if  today < yesterday :
    print("It is getting colder!")
else :
    if  today > yesterday :
        print("It is getting warmer!")
    else :
        print("Temperature is the same as yesterday!")
