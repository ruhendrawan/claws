## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_list_change
#problem description: Construct a program that increments all values of the list by 1.
#Step 1: Define and initialize the list
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
#Step 2: Iterate through the list elements
for i in range(len(lst)):
    #Step 2.1: Increment the element at index i by 1
    lst[i] += 1
#Step 3: Print the list
print(lst)
