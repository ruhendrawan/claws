## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_list_rotate_left_twice
#problem description: Construct a program that has a function that receives a list of values and returns the list rotated to the left by 2 position so that the value at the front of the list goes to the second last position, the second value of the list goes to the back, and the order of the other values stays the same. For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the program will change it to [3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2].
#Step 1: Define the function
def rotate_left_by_2(lst):
    #Step 1.1: Store the first two values of the list in local variables
    first = lst[0]
    second = lst[1]
    #Step 1.2: Rotate the remaining values of the list to the left by 2 position
    for i in range(len(lst)-2):
        lst[i] = lst[i + 2]
    #Step 1.3: Move the first two values of the list to the back of the list
    lst[len(lst)-2] = first
    lst[len(lst)-1] = second
    return lst
#Step 2: Call the function
values = [3, 8, 9, 8, 7, 5]
print("Original list:", values)
print("Rotated list: ", rotate_left_by_2(values))
