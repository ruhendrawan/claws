You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_repeated_sequence2
#problem description: Construct a program that receives an integer N from the user and prints a sequence of space-separated numbers from 1 to N such that the N-th number in the sequence is repeated N times.
#Step 1: Read the integer N that the user enters
N = int(input("Enter the integer N: "))
#Step 2: Print N space-separated numbers
for i in range(1, N+1):
    #Step 2.1: Print the i-th number i times
    for j in range(1, i+1):
        print(i)
