Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_check_adjacent
#problem description: Construct a program that checks whether a sequence of numbers, entered one at a time, contains adjacent duplicates. The user enters -1 to indicate the end of the input. For example, 4 is a duplicate in the sequence of numbers 1, 3, 4, 4, -1.
#Step 1: Read the first number that the user enters
text = input("Enter a number: ")
num = float(text)
#Step 2: Read the rest of the numbers that the user enters and check for adjacent duplicates
while num != -1 :
    previous = num
    text = input("Enter a number: ")
    num = float(text)
    if num == previous :
        print("Duplicate input for number:", num)
```
