Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_list_rotate
#problem description: Construct a program that has a function that receives a list of values and returns the list rotated to the left by 1 position so that the value at the front of the list goes to the back and the order of the other values stays the same. For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the program will change it to [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1].
#Step 1: Define the function
def rotate_left(lst):
    #Step 1.1: Store the value at the front in a local variable
    first = lst[0]
    #Step 1.2: Rotate the remaining values of the list to the left
    for i in range(len(lst)-1):
        lst[i] = lst[i + 1]
    #Step 1.3: Move the value at the front to the back of the list
    lst[len(lst)-1] = first
    return lst
#Step 2: Call the function
values =  [3, 8, 9, 8, 7, 5]
print("Original list:", values)
print("Rotated list: ", rotate_left(values))
