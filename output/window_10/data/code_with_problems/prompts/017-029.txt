Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_point2
#problem description: Construct a class that represents a point in the Euclidean plane. The class should contain data that represents the point’s integer coordinates (x,y). The point's coordinates could be accessed or changed only through the getter and setter methods. The class should also include a method to calculate and return the point's distance from the origin (0,0).
#Step 1: Define the class
class Point2 :
    #Step 1.1: Declare the method to calculate and return the point's distance from the origin
    def distance_from_origin(self) :
        return (self.__x * self.__x + self.__y * self.__y) ** 0.5
    #Step 1.2: Define the setter and getter methods for the x-coordinate of the point
    def set_x(self, new_x) :
        self.__x = new_x
    def get_x(self) :
        return self.__x
    #Step 1.3: Define the setter and getter methods for the y-coordinate of the point
    def set_y(self, new_y) :
        self.__y = new_y
    def get_y(self) :
        return self.__y
#Step 2: Test the class
p2 = Point2()
p2.set_x(7)
p2.set_y(2)
print("p2 coordinates: (" + str(p2.get_x()) + ", " + str(p2.get_y()) + ")")
print("Distance of p2 from origin = " + str(p2.distance_from_origin()))
```
