Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_three_boolean2
#problem description:  Construct a program that determines whether at least one of the three boolean variables is False based on the inputs that it receives from the user.
#Step 1: Read the user input for the value of the first boolean variable (variable a)
text = input("Enter 1 if the value of the first boolean variable (variable a) is True, otherwise enter 0:")
input_num = int(text)
#Step 2: Determine whether the value of the first boolean variable (variable a) is True
if input_num == 1 :
    a = True
else:
    a = False
#Step 3: Read the user input for the value of the second boolean variable (variable b)
text = input("Enter 1 if the value of the second boolean variable (variable b) is True, otherwise enter 0:")
input_num = int(text)
#Step 4: Determine whether the value of the second boolean variable (variable b) is True
if input_num == 1 :
    b = True
else:
    b = False
#Step 5: Read the user input for the value of the third boolean variable (variable c)
text = input("Enter 1 if the value of the third boolean variable (variable c) is True, otherwise enter 0:")
input_num = int(text)
#Step 6: Determine whether the value of the third boolean variable (variable c) is True
if input_num == 1 :
    c = True
else:
    c = False
#Step 7: Write the boolean expression to determine whether at least one of the three boolean variables is False
result = not (a and b and c)
#Step 8: Print the result
if result == True :
    print("Yes! At least one of the three boolean variables is False.")
else:
    print("No! None of the boolean variables are False.")
