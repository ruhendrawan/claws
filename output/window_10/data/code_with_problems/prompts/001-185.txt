#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_print_medals
#problem description: Assume that we have a 7x4 matrix that stores the number of medals that seven countries won in the skating competitions at the Winter Olympic. This matrix looks like as follows: [[ "Canada", 1, 0, 1 ],[ "China", 1, 1, 0 ],...] Each row of this matrix corresponds to the medal counts for the country in that row. The second, third, and fourth numbers within a row represent the number of Gold, Silver, and Bronze medals won by the corresponding country in that row. Construct a program that takes this matrix and prints a table of medal counts with row total that shows the number of Gold, Silver, Bronze, and Total medals for each of the countries who participated in the competition. The output table should look like as follows:
#    Country    Gold  Silver  Bronze   Total
#     Canada        1       0       1            2
#      China        1       1       0            2
#Step 1: Define a 7x4 matrix that stores the number of medals won by seven countries
medal_counts = [[ "CAN", 1, 0, 1 ],
                [ "CHN", 1, 1, 0 ],
                [ "GER", 0, 0, 1 ],
                [ "KOR", 1, 0, 0 ],
                [ "JPN", 0, 1, 1 ],
                [ "RUS", 0, 1, 1 ],
                [ "USA", 1, 1, 0 ]]
#Step 2: Print the header of the output table
print("{:>4s}{:>3s}{:>3s}{:>3s}{:>4s}".format("Name","G","S","B","All"))
#Step 3: Iterate through the rows in the medal counts matrix
for i in range(len(medal_counts)):
    #Step 3.1: Assign initial values to variables we need for printing row i
    line = "{:>4s}".format(medal_counts[i][0])
    row_total = 0
    #Step 3.2: Iterate through the columns that have medal counts
    for j in range(1, len(medal_counts[0])):
        #Step 3.2.1: Append medal counts to the content of row i
        line += "{:>3d}".format(medal_counts[i][j])
        #Step 3.2.2: Update the row total for row i
        row_total += medal_counts[i][j]
    #Step 3.3: Add the row total to the content of the output table for row i
    line += "{:>3d}".format(row_total)
    #Step 3.4: Print the content of the output table for row i
    print(line)
