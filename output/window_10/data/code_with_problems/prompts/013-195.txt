You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_temperature
#problem description : Construct a program that reads a series of temperatures and reports the average temperature and the number of the days that are above the average. Assume that the input values could have a decimal point.
#Step 1: Read the number of days that we have to enter their temperature data
num_days = int(input("Enter the number of temperature values that will be entered: "))
#Step 2: Read the temperature values
temps = []
total = 0
for i in range(num_days):
    val = float(input("Enter the temperature: "))
    temps.append(val)
    total += val
#Step 3: Calculate the average temperature
average = 0
if num_days == 0:
    print("No temperature values were entered.")
else:
    average = total / num_days
#Step 4: Count the number of the days that are above the average temperature
above = 0
for x in temps:
    if x > average:
        above += 1
#Step 5: Display the results
print("Average temperature:", average)
print(above, "days above average.")
