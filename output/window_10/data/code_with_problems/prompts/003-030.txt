#exercise type: py
#exercise name: objects_classes_account
#problem description : Construct a class that represents a basic bank account. This class should contain data representing the name of the account’s owner, the account number, and the account’s current balance; all of which could be accessed or changed only through the getter and setter methods. An instance of the class should be created by specifying three parameters that are used to initialize the instance (i.e., object) data. The other methods of this class should perform various services on the account (making deposits, withdrawals, adding interest to the account). These methods should examine the data passed into them to make sure the requested transaction is valid.
#Step 1: Define the class
class Account1 :
    #Step 1.1: Initialize the account with the specified values
    def __init__(self, owner, account, initial) :
        self.__acct_name = owner
        self.__acct_number = account
        self.__balance = initial
    #Step 1.2: Define a method to perform the deposit transaction
    def deposit(self, amount) :
        if (amount > 0) :
            self.__balance = self.__balance + amount
        return self.__balance
    #Step 1.3: Define a method to perform a withdraw transaction
    def withdraw(self, amount, fee) :
        if (amount > 0 and fee >= 0 and amount+fee < self.__balance) :
            self.__balance = self.__balance - amount - fee
        return self.__balance
    #Step 1.4: Define a method to add interest to the account
    def add_interest(self) :
        self.__balance += (self.__balance * 0.035)
        return self.__balance
    #Step 1.5: Define the methods to get the  state of the account
    def get_name(self) :
        return self.__acct_name
    def get_balance(self) :
        return self.__balance
    def get_acct_number(self) :
        return self.__acct_number
#Step 2: Test the class
acct1 = Account1("Tina Murphy", 72354, 25.59)
acct2 = Account1("Angelica Adams", 69713, 500.00)
acct3 = Account1("Edward Demsey", 93757, 769.32)
acct1.deposit(44.10)
adams_balance = acct2.deposit(75.25)
print("{:s}'s balance after deposit: {:.2f}".format(acct2.get_name(), adams_balance))
print("{:s}'s balance after deposit: {:.2f}".format(acct2.get_name(), acct2.withdraw (480, 1.50)))
acct3.withdraw(-100.00, 1.50)
acct2.add_interest()
print("{:s}'s balance after adding interest: {:.2f}".format(acct2.get_name(), acct2.get_balance()))
