You are an annotation assistant.
Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

NonNestedIteration,SingleForLoopIteration,"SingleForLoopIteration refers to a single use use of a for-loop that has no nested structure
When identifying nested loop structures, classify the entire structure under the appropriate nested loop category only (e.g., NestedForLoopIteration). Do not also include the single-loop categories for the outer loop"
