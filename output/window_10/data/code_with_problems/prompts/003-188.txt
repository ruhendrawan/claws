## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_average_list_elements 
#problem description: Construct a program that has a function that receives a list and calculates the average of the values in that list. The program should handle lists with arbitrary number of values (including an empty list).
#Step 1: Define the function
def calculate_list_average(lst):
    #Step 1.1: Assign initial value to the variable which we need for this program
    total = 0
    #Step 1.2: Iterate through the list values and add each value to the running total
    for x in lst:
        total += x
    #Step 1.3: Calculate and print the average of the list values
    if len(lst) == 0 :
        print("The list has no values.")
    else :
        average = total / len(lst)
        print("Average is:", average)
#Step 2: Call the function
values = [6, 15, 9, 12, 1, 8]
calculate_list_average(values)
