Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_work_hours
#problem description: Suppose we have an input file that contains information about how many hours each employee of a company has worked. The file looks like the following (Employee's name, Hours):
#Erica 7.5 8.5 10.25 8 8.5
# Erin 10.5 11.5 12 11 10.75
# Simone 8 8 8
# ...
# Construct a program that reads this file and calculates the total number of hours worked by each individual. Make sure that the program handles each specific exception that could occur. 
#Step 1: Define the function
def report_work_hours(file_name):
    #Step 1.1: Enclose the code that might throw an exception within the try block
    try :
        #Step 1.1.1: Open the file and process each line in the file
        myfile = open( file_name, "r")
        for line in myfile:
            tokens = line.split()
            name = tokens[0]
            total = 0.0;
            for i in range(1, len(tokens)) :
                try :
                    total += float(tokens[i])
                except ValueError:
                    print("Error in the hour.")
            print("Total hours worked by " + name  + " = " + str(total))
        #Step 1.1.2: Close the file
        myfile.close()
    #Step 1.2: Handle all possible exceptions that may be thrown in the try block
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("File not found")
    except IOError:
        print("Problem with the file!")
#Step 2: Call the function
name = input("Enter the full path of a file: ")
