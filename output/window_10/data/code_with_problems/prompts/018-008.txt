## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_rent_car3
# problem description: Construct a program that determines whether a customer could rent a car based on the inputs that it receives from the car rental agent. Rental cars are available to licensed drivers who are either at least 21 years old or have a credit card with $10,000 or more of credit.
#Step 1: Read the input for the customer's age
text = input("Enter the customer's age:")
age = int(text)
#Step 2: Read the input for determining whether the customer has driver's license
text = input("Enter 1 if the customer has driver's license, otherwise enter 0:")
input_num = int(text)
#Step 3: Determine whether the customer has driver's license
if input_num == 1 :
    has_license = True
else:
    has_license = False
#Step 4: Read the input for the customer's credit amount
text = input("Enter the customer's credit amount:")
credit = int(text)
#Step 5: Write the boolean expression to determine whether a customer could rent a car
can_rent_car = has_license and (age >= 21 or credit >= 10000)
#Step 6: Print the result
if can_rent_car == True :
    print("Yes! The customer could rent a car.")
else:
    print("No! The customer could not rent a car.")
