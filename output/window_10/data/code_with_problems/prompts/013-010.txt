Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_check_age2
#problem description : Construct a program that asks the user to enter a string that has the user name and age separated by a colon, and prints whether the user is a teenager. Make sure that the program handles all possible exceptions. The program must ask the user for an input until the user enters a string that could be processed without any exception.
#Step 1: Define the function
def check_age():
    #Step 1.1: Ask for a valid input as long as the input could not be processed; otherwise stop
    processed = False
    while not processed :
        s = input("Enter the name and age, separated by a colon:")
        #Step 1.1.1: Split the given string into the name and age
        lst = s.split(":")
        #Step 1.1.2: Enclose the code that might throw an exception within the try block
        try:
            name = lst[0]
            age = int(lst[1])
            if age >= 13 and age <= 19 :
                print(name + " is a teenager.")
            else:
                print(name + " is not a teenager.")
            processed = True
        #Step 1.1.3: Handle all possible exceptions that may be thrown in the try block
