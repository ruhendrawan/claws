Given a code snippet, evaluate all rows in the ontology classes CSV.
Provide a reason for how the class is being used in the snippet/ problem, evaluate, and give a usage score.

## Output
Respond as long as possible.
Score is between 0-5.
Return as a CSV (exercise_name,parent,leaf,reason,score).

## INPUT: Code Snippet
```code
#exercise type: py
#exercise name: py_average_float
#problem description: Construct a program that reads a series of non-negative floating-point numbers from the user, sums them up, and calculate their average. Note that you need to think what value should the program use to indicate the end of the input.
#Step 1: Define the variables that we need for this program
total = 0
count = 0
#/Step 2: Read the first number that the user enters
text = input("Enter a number: ")
num = float(text)
#Step 3: Process the number that the user has entered, then receive and process the next numbers as long as the user enters a non-negative number; otherwise stop
while num >= 0.0 :
    count += 1
    total += num
    print("The sum so far is", total, ", count =", count)
    text = input("Enter a number: ")
    num = float(text)
#Step 4: Calculate and print the average of the numbers entered by the user
if count == 0 :
    print("No numbers were entered.")
else :
    average = total / count
print("The average is:", average)
